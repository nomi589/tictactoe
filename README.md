## Tic Tac Toe

An intelligent tic tac toe game programmed in Ruby language. The 'intelligent' part is that the computer, instead of just making random moves, actually stops the player from winning (if winning is possible on the next move) or actively tries to win (again, if possible).

## Requirements

The only requirements to play are to have a command line terminal and, secondly, to have Ruby installed on the system.

## How to play

Just type `ruby tictactoe.rb` once Ruby has been installed to play the game.
